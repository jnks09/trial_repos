		<h3>Web Developer</h3>
		<p>Getings! I am a web developer. I've got a passion for front end web development, and the back end know-how to support that. I love to use cutting edge technology and the latest web standards to craft lean, mean and clean code that runs like greased lightning. I like to work alongside designers to see their vision come to life. I am comfortable in this field, as I am learning here, I am also currently pursuing my Batchelors Degree.</p>
